## 1.1 Background and Motivation
Gaming has been one of the most profitable industries of humankind, it contains varieties of genres such as sport, sci-fi, horror, music, adventure and many more that you could possibly think of, but in order to create these games they require magnificent software developers like us Kasetsart University’s Faculty of Engineering’s Software and Knowledge Engineering graduate students to give birth to them elegantly providing humankind happinesses in the process.
## 1.2 Propose and Objective
We software engineers are what you might call “Gamers with skills”. We may be addicted to gaming that we played them morning til night but with each round we constantly struggle to achieve victory in every single game. We also sometimes wondered “How did they create this game?”, “Why did they make it this way?”, “Could we make it better?”. With these thoughts in mind we then got an idea to start making games in the way we think are better for us intelligent sentient beings.
## 1.3 Scope of Works
If we want to create a game for this project then we would not want to make something too simple such as cloning existing games or too complex for a two people team, so with that in mind we have to start with an idea of this game which we decided to go with turn-based strategy chess game with unique characters to perform their special skills and movements to complete different goals throughout the game to gain progression on their characters, skills and equipments as well as going through interesting game story.
